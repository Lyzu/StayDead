# StayDead

## Summary
Tired of members releasing their spirit after they died although you mentioned multiple times, that there will be a mass resurrection? Well, this addon might be the one to help with that issue. Everyone in your raid has to install this addon. The leader (and only the leader) of the raid can then issue a command to activate StayDead. Once activated the "Release Spirit" button will be hidden if you die.

### Commands
`/sd on`      *   - will hide the "Release Spirit" button
`/sd off`     *   - will show the "Release Spirit" button for future deaths

`/sd release`   * - will release the group/raid
`/sd releaseme`   - will release your spirit (in case you need to manually do that)
`/sd status`      - print the status of the StayDead functionality

* requires leader or assist
